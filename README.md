# AppliedDataScience
I took the course Applied Data Science in Spring 2023 and learned about the exciting expansion of data science into the social sciences. I got hands-on experience applying data science techniques to real-world problems and questions. This repository contains the code and write-up for my final project.

## Final project description:
Have you ever looked at a couple and thought that they looked alike? Well couples can exhibit many more similarities, such as in personality, language usage, and physiology. 
Couples' synchronization of their physiology is a fascinating phenomenon termed physiological linkage, and it may have implications for their relationship. I conducted a study with my classmates to understand physiological linkage and its implications better.

## File descriptions:
